# Stanford AI4ALL 2022
#### Used neural networks to make a plane autonomously taxi down a runway and take off through the X-Plane 11 Flight Simulator! 

**Goal:** To create an algorithm enabling the plane simulation to run on the centerline of the tarmac without overfitting or underfitting.
* PID control was used to get an ideal trajectory
* Gradient Descent was used for optimization, which used strategy from both Manual Input and Grid Search
