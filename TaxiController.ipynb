    "\n",
    "Because we are not using any image data yet, we technically don't need to use X-Plane 11 for this part of the project. One pro of using X-Plane 11 is that it makes our controller look way more realistic and can provide super cool videos for your final presentation :). A drawback of using it though is that it will slow down our simulation, which isn't great if we want to easily try out a lot of control gains when we tune the controller. For this part of the project, we will get the best of both worlds by adding an input to our function that specifies whether or not to move the aircraft along the trajectory in X-Plane 11. By default, this value is set to False (will not use X-Plane 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have started by intializing some variables for you. Your job is to fill in the for loop that will simulate the closed-loop system. Here is a rough outline of the steps your code should follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store the current crosstrack error, heading error, and downtrack position**. We want to keep track of the trajectory of the aircraft during our simulation so that we can plot it and analyze it after. To do this, we have defined three arrays for you: `cte_history`, `he_history`, and `dtp_history`. To start each loop iteration, you should store the values of these variables at the next slot in the array.\n",
    "2. **Decide if we should update our control**. Most real-world systems operate at a specific frequency, meaning that they only update their control every so often. For our simulation, we will only update our control (steering angle) on certain iterations of the loop controlled by the `ctrl_every` input. The default for this input is 20, so we only want to update our control at iteration 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, etc. What condition can we use to determine this? HINT: check out (python's modulo operator)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-modulo-operator-what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-python-solved/]. Can you come up with a condition using this operator that would only be true when i is a multiple of `ctrl_every`?\n",
    "3. **If we should update our control, update it**. To do this, we need to get the cte and he using the `getState` function and then input those into the `getControl` function to get a new value for `phiDeg`.\n",
    "4. **Get the next state based on the dynamics**. Call your dynamics function with the appropriate inputs.\n",
    "5. **If we are using the simulator, tell the simulator to move to that state**. You can use the function `setHomeState(client, cte, dtp, he)`"
